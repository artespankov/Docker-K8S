Deployment object is created during execution of run command on Pod:
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:1.7.12

List Deployments:
kubectl get deployments nginx

Deployments are managing ReplicaSets run under deployment-assigned label:
kubectl get replicasets --selector=run=nginx

Save existing Deployment config into YAML
kubectl get deployments nginx --export -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml

Edit, then save Deployment config:
kubectl replace --save-config -f nginx-deployment.yaml
After that, it's possible to reapply config in common way:
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
