To provide connection to external storage (or service):
Create new service without Pod selector

Example - set with DNS name:
spec:
    type: ExternalName
    externalName: "<external_dns>"

Set with IP instead of DNS:
metadata:
    name: external


To enable data storage - separate storage data
and application serving this dataset

Data can be stored on persistent Volume
(and don't rely on any PODs or containers).
It then can be moved on other machine along with PODs and
can be securely stored, don't damage or disappear
because of POD/container crash.

After new PersistentVolume object being created, it must be attached to POD
(with PersistentVolumeClaim object)
