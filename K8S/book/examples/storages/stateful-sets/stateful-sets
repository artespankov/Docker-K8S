StatefulSets are replicated groups of pods similar to ReplicaSets,
but unlike RS, the have properties:
    - Each replica gets a persistent hostname with unique index
      (e.g. database-0, database-1, etc.)
    - On create (scale up) the order of creation lowest -> highest index
    - On delete (scale down) the order is highest -> lowest
